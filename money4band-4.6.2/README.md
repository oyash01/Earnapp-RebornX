![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/MRColorR/money4band/release-on-tag.yml?style=flat-square&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMRColorR%2Fmoney4band)

  

**|Easy automatic multi-app passive income project with Web Dashboard, Auto Updater, and Proxy Support :dollar::satisfied:|**

  

## Quick Overview üöÄ

**Money4Band** leverages unused internet bandwidth, allowing you to make money with something you have and would otherwise be wasted. It utilizes containerized versions of apps like EarnApp, Honeygain, IPRoyal Pawns, PacketStream, Peer2Profit, Repocket, Earnfm, Proxyrack, Proxylite, Bitping, Grass, Packetshare, Gradient and more. It's also safer than installing and using these native apps on your host system.

  

‚ú® **Key Features:**

-  **Multiplatform** and lightweight Docker stack.

-  **Automatic Updates** to keep your applications up-to-date.

-  **Web Dashboard** for easy monitoring.

-  **Proxy Support** for enhanced flexibility.

  

üåê For a detailed overview and FAQ, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/wiki) or join our [Discord Community](#-join-the-money4band-community-on-discord).

  

## Getting Started üö•

  

### Prerequisites 

- Ensure that you have a 64-bit operating system, virtualization functions are enabled, and Docker is installed and able to auto-start on system boot.

- (Optional) For ARM devices like Raspberry Pi, installing an emulation layer for non-ARM native Docker images is recommended. Even though the script can assist with the installation, we recommend users install an emulation layer by themselves following the [Wiki](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/wiki) guide.

- (Optional) On Windows, ensure the Virtualization Platform and Windows Subsystem for Linux are active as Docker requires these features. Even though the script can assist with the installation, we recommend users enable these Windows functions by themselves following the [Wiki](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/wiki) guide.

  

### Quick Setup Guide üßë‚Äçüíª

  

#### Preferred Method: Using Release Artifacts üì¶

  

1.  **Download** the latest release of Money4Band for your operating system from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/releases).

	-  **Linux Users:**

		- Download the `Money4Band-ubuntu-latest-x64-<version>.tar.gz` file.

		- Extract the tar.gz file:```tar -xvzf Money4Band-ubuntu-latest-x64-<version>.tar.gz```

		- Navigate to the extracted folder and run the script:```./money4band``` 
		- **Note:** You can make sure it is executable on your OS with ```chmod +x money4band```

	-  **macOS Users:**

		- Download the `Money4Band-macos-latest-x64-<version>.tar.gz` file.

	-  **ARM Devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi):**

		- Download the appropriate ARM release from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/releases) (e.g., `arm64` or `armv7`).

		- Follow the same steps as Linux users.

  

2.  **Register** accounts on the application websites. [Here's a list of available apps](#app-compatibility-and-sign-up-links-).

  

3.  **Run** the guided setup through the Money4Band application:

	- Follow the on-screen instructions to configure and start the services.

  

4.  **Start Earning** passively and monitor your performance through the web dashboard.

  

#### Alternative Method (any OS): Cloning the Repository / running from source code üîÄ

  

If you prefer to clone the repository (or contribute to the project):

  

1.  **Clone** the project:```git clone https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band.git && cd money4band```

	-  **OR** download the ZIP and extract it using one of the options below:
		- ```wget https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && unzip main.zip && cd money4band-main```
		- ```Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -OutFile main.zip; Expand-Archive -Path main.zip -DestinationPath .\ ; cd money4band*```
2.  **Run** the project from source code:```pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 main.py```
	- Feel free to create a virtual environment first if you want to keep your OS Python installation cleaner: `python3 -m venv venvm4b`
 	- Remember to activate the virtual environment by using:
	  - (Linux/Mac):  ```source venvm4b/bin/activate```
	  - (Windows): ```venvm4b\.Scripts\activate```

  
  
  

#### M4B v3 legacy Setup Guide üßì

1.  **Download** the latest version of Money4Band from the [Releases](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/releases) or git clone the project.
2.  **Register** accounts on the application websites. [Here's a list of availabe apps](#app-compatibility-and-sign-up-links-)
3.  **Access the Money4Band v3 Folder**: The legacy code of M4B v3 is included with the new releases and is located in a subfolder. To run the old M4B v3 bash or PowerShell scripts, navigate to this subfolder and use one of the following options:
	- **(Linux/Mac):** ```sudo chmod +x runme.sh && ./runme.sh```
	- **(Windows):**```Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force; .\runme.ps1```


4.  **Follow the remaining standard steps until completion**

## Scale Up with Multi-Proxy Support üåê

  

**Money4Band** has the ability to create multiple instances also using a proxy list, ideal for scaling up your setup. Quickly set up numerous instances each linked to a different proxy with ease.

  

### Getting Started with Multi-Proxy

1.  **Prepare Proxies**: Create a `proxies.txt` file in the root folder of M4B, listing each proxy on a separate line and ending with a new line.
	- Proxy entries can be formatted in one of the following ways:
 		- **With Authentication:** `protocol://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy_url:proxy_port`
   		-  **Without Authentication:** `protocol://proxy_url:proxy_port`
2. **Start M4B and do the Setup**: During the setup Money4Band will ask you if you want to setup mutiplroxy, reply yes and follow the steps.

### Getting Started with Multi-Proxy (Legacy M4B v3)
1.  **Initial Setup**: First, set up the main instance using `runme.sh` with a proxy.
2.   **Prepare Proxies**: Create a `proxies.txt` in the root folder, listing each remaning proxy on a separate line and ending with a new line.
3.   **Run the multiproxy instances**: Use the "Setup and manage multiproxy instances by list" in the M4B menu or execute `runmproxies` script in the terminal. 

>  **Notice:** While using multiple proxies, be aware that only certain apps permit proxy usage per their Terms of Service. We recommend using personal, private proxies with IPs not flagged as proxies and always respecting the ToS of each app.

> **Notice:** Proxy entries can be formatted in one of the following ways:
>	- **With Authentication:** `protocol://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy_url:proxy_port`
> 	-  **Without Authentication:** `protocol://proxy_url:proxy_port`
